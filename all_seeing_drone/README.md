# all_seeing_drone
This is a project to work with the RoboLink CoDrone (https://www.robolink.com/codrone/). 

It isn't completed, but it specifically introduces computer vision and movements off of the computer vision to work towards the CoDrone autonomously following someone.

Most of this project needs the CoDrone's bluetooth module with drivers plugged into the computer (to command the drone), as well as the computer to be connected to the CoDrone's wifi (to get the video stream). To use this, setup a virtual python environment using the requirements.txt file, and then use that environment in a jupyter notebook context using Drone Demo.ipynb, or simply run the run_drone.py script in Python.
