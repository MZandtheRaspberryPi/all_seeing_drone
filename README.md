This is a monorepo for a collection of scripts and functionality, some practical and useful day to day, others with no redeeming usefulness other than fun! Sub folders from this directory each represent a distinct project.

all_seeing_drone  
A project to introduce autonomous movement and face-following for a robolink CoDrone. See the README [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/im_practical_programming/tree/master/all_seeing_drone).

Notice it tracking me!

Here's a youtube video showing off the project. There's a link in the description of this video to another video that is more technical and shows some of the project work.
